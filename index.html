                        <p><span class="fa fa-quote-left"></span> One evening, August 2017, some time after elections, I was arranging the books underneath our dining table, busy ranting how we should get rid of the no-longer used accumulating books that
                            were piled up under the dining table.<br>So, my mom suggested that we should give them away to kids in Taita, since they can't afford books. So I stopped ranting, finished arranging the books and thoughts started streaming
                            in on how I could impact lives.<br>So eventually I told my mom I wanted to start collecting books and put up libraries in schools. She told me to consult my Uncle Boli who had done a similar project some time back. So he advised
                            that I had to work with a team of people and plan adversely in order since its a bulky project. It was back to the drawing board which is where I came up with this organization.</p>

                        <li>To remind the children that they are not forgotten and that they also can get a proper education. They can access resources to expand their knowledge beyond classroom level and think in multiple dimensions and perspectives.</li>
                        <li>It also goes out to that kid in school who would want to pronounce a word right, learn a different language in the future, wants to read as many novels as they can and wonders how the universe came to be, all the kids who want
                            to learn the most basic to the most complex concpects a mind can comprehend but lack the resources and infrastructure to get the knowledge.</li>
